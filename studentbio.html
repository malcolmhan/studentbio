<p>And why do I love Batman so much? Is it because he's sometimes so emo? Is it because he's such a sad, broken character? Is it his master detective skills? Or his super cool gadgets? And his really awesome batmobiles? Is it because he's super rich and kinda hot? (I am a girl, ok?!) Is it because he has a witty butler named Alfred? Or maybe it's because he has a T-rex in his batcave? (Yup, this is probably the reason) Whatever the reason, I love Batman! Why do you?</p>
